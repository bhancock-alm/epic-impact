    "# Analyzing the Impact of *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Ben Hancock](https://www.law.com/author/profile/Ben-Hancock/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part of a data journalism project by the *National Law Journal* to assess the impact of *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*, a May 2018 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that centered on the enforceability of mandatory workplace arbitration agreements. In collaboration with [Casetext](https://casetext.com/), we identified and categorized nearly a hundred federal district and appellate decisions that cited *Epic* in calendar year 2018, in order to quantify the scope of Supreme Court's impact on this issue. You can read more about our methodology here **INSERT LINK**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are looking at a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a saved interactive data analysis and computing session that uses the Python programming language. Our goal in presenting this to our audience is to \"show our work\" and give greater transparency into the approach we took in reporting an issue with wide public interest and significance. Even if you're not a programmer, our hope is that you can follow along at a high level -- with the help of plain-language comments interspersed below -- and see the steps we took to arrive at the figures cited in our final article **INSERT LINK**. At bottom, we show you how we generated one of the main data visualizations presented in the story. If you're just interested in seeing the underlying data, that's available here **INSERT LINK**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a experiment for our newsroom that aims to foster conversation with our audience in a new way. If you have questions, comments, or critiques, feel free to contact me at [bhancock@alm.com](mailto:bhancock@alm.com).\n",
